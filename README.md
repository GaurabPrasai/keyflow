## What is Keyflow?

Keyflow is a minimalistic typing web app built with modern web technologies, it provides a seamless typing practice experience that adapts to both desktop and mobile environments.

## Distinctiveness & Complexity

Keyflow is designed as a typing practice application centered on real-time performance and interactivity. This focus on continuous user input, instant validation, and live statistics makes it unique within the course context.

In terms of complexity, Keyflow is challenging because of how much happens in real time. Every keystroke from the user is captured, validated, and used to update typing statistics instantly. This required careful use of **React state management**, including Context API and custom hooks, to share data across components efficiently. For example, when the user types a character, the app needs to immediately check if it‚Äôs correct, update the cursor, recalculate accuracy and WPM, and re-render the stats on the screen.

Although the frontend (React) holds most of the logic, the **Django backend** is still important. It manages data, provides API endpoints, and handles authentication. Having to integrate React with Django also added to the complexity, since I had to make the two work together smoothly.

Some of the features that made the project complex:

-   Real-time WPM and accuracy calculation
    
-   Multiple text datasets with chunk loading
    
-   Settings panel for customizing font size, sounds, and colors
    
-   Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
    

Altogether, this project proved more challenging than previous ones, as it pushed me beyond my existing skills and required learning many new concepts. The most valuable insight I got is that how the software development lifecycle works, from planning and architecture to implementation and testing, It provide me a practical understanding of how complex applications are built in the real world.

## Architecture



### Real-Time Typing Processing Flow

The core typing engine processes keystrokes with advanced features like dynamic scrolling and focus mode:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Keystroke] --> B[handleEnhancedInputChange]
    B --> C[handleInputChange]
    B --> D[handleTypingStart]
    
    C --> E{Character Validation}
    E -->|Correct| F[Mark Correct + Click Sound]
    E -->|Incorrect| G[Mark Incorrect + Error Sound]
    
    F --> H[Update Character Status]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Calculate Progress]
    I --> J{Progress > 70%?}
    
    J -->|Yes| K[Load Next Chunk]
    J -->|No| L[Continue Current]
    
    H --> M[scrollToCurrentChar]
    M --> N[Transform Text Display]
    
    D --> O[Apply Focus Mode]
    O --> P[Hide UI Elements]
    P --> Q[5s Timer Reset]

```

### Dynamic Text Management System

Advanced text chunking and infinite scroll implementation:

    B --> C[Shuffle Words Array]
    C --> D[Create Initial 100-word Chunk]
    
    D --> E[useTyping Hook]
    E --> F[Real-time Progress Tracking]
    F --> G{Progress > 80%?}
    
    G -->|Yes| H[checkAndLoadNext]
    G -->|No| I[Continue Current Text]
    
    H --> J[Load Next 100 Words]
    J --> K[Append to Text Display]
    K --> L[Update processedWords Array]
    
    M[End of Dataset?] --> N[Re-shuffle & Restart]
    N --> D
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style E fill:#f3e5f5
    style H fill:#fff3e0
    style L fill:#e8f5e8

```

### Component Interaction Map

    P --> R[Font Size]
    P --> S[Sound Enabled]
    P --> T[Text Dataset]
    
    U[ThemeContext] --> V[Dark/Light Mode]
    W[AuthContext] --> X[User State]
    Y[TextDataContext] --> Z[Typing State & Text Management]
    
    style D fill:#e3f2fd
    style P fill:#f3e5f5
    style Y fill:#fff3e0

```
